# setlister
Application for creating custom setlists and displaying song lyrics and chords.

At this point i am not completley sure where i am going with this but i will try something like this : 

-> User management(Creating an account, deleting an account, updating an account)
-> Setlist management(User can have one or multiple setlists)
-> Song Management(User can have one or multiple song under his account.)
-> Custom autoscroll feature(by god this alone could make millions)
-> Target device should be tablet

Stack should be something i am interested in, and something with what i can develop pretty quickly.

So i would go with something like i am working on at work.
Postgresql -> Db
Golang -> Backend
Vue -> Frontend(I should maybe consider quasar)

This would be a perfect project to implement tests all over it.
Besides that postgresql migrator
Maybe docker ? Althought that is kind of an overkill.

Consider TDD

Definitley ambicious plans.
